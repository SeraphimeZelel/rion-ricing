  <summary>üåà Pywal</summary>
    
### Overview
Pywal is a tool that generates a color palette from the dominant colors in an image. It then applies the colors system-wide and on-the-fly in all of your favourite programs.

### Configuration
1. Paste the `.config/wal` into `~/.config/wal`
2. `wallpaper-picker.sh` calls pywal to generate color palette based on the wallpaper name (if the theme exists) or the dominant color of your wallpaper. i.e. I have `.config/wal/themes/Arknights.json` so if I set my wallpaper to `Arknights_Amiya` it applies the predefined theme rather than the dominant color of the wallpaper. It also calls `.config/wal/hooks/hooks.sh`.
3. `hooks.sh` syncs the theme across all of the applications that are being used.

  <summary>üñº wallpaper-picker.sh</summary>

### What it does
- Provides a wallpaper picker using **Wofi** with image thumbnails.  
- Automatically applies Pywal colors, updates GNOME wallpaper, changes Fastfetch logo, and runs hooks.  
- Integrates with **Pywalfox** to update Firefox theme.  

### Notes on Color Backends
Pywal supports different color extraction backends that slightly change the generated palette.  
You can switch backends by adding the `--backend` argument after `"$WAL_BIN" -i "$SELECTED"` in `wallpaper-picker.sh`.  

- **wal (default)** ‚Üí balanced palette, optimized for terminals.  
- **colorz** ‚Üí stronger contrast, fewer dominant colors. (Looks great on Chiori wallpapers).  
- **haishoku** ‚Üí softer palettes with lower contrast. 

This setup is optimized for the default **wal** backend.  
However, you can further customize the derived color variables if you‚Äôre not satisfied with the results:

- üé∂ For **Cava**, change the gradient source in `cava-pywalsync.sh`, e.g.  
  ```bash
  COLOR1=$(jq -r '.colors.color8' "$WAL_COLORS")
  ```
  to
  ```bash
  COLOR1=$(jq -r '.colors.color5' "$WAL_COLORS")
  ```

- üí¨ For Discord, edit the variables inside `~/.config/BetterDiscord/bd-template.css`, replacing var(--color) with another Pywal color of your choice.

#### Installing extra backends

```bash
pip install colorz
pip install haishoku
```
